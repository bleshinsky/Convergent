## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Obsidian (for testing)
- Git

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Convergent.git
cd Convergent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the plugin
npm run build

# Development mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run dev
```

### Testing in Obsidian

1. Create a test vault (or use an existing one)
2. Create the plugins folder: `.obsidian/plugins/convergent/`
3. Copy these files to that folder:
   - `main.js`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `styles.css`
4. Reload Obsidian
5. Enable Convergent in Community Plugins settings

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Avoid `any` type when possible

### File Organization

```
